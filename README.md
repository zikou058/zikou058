# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Zakaria Mennis**, a Full Stack Web Developer.

I specialize in building scalable web solutions and seamless, user-centric applications. I love turning complex problems into elegant, functional code.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React, Css, Html, and Tailwind**. I'm also deeply interested in system architecture and performance optimization.

I've built various public repositories, focusing on clean code and modern web standards.

If you want to collaborate or just say hi, feel free to reach out!
